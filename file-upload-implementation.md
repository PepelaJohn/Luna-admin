# File Upload Implementation for Expense Receipts

## Overview

This document outlines the complete implementation of file upload functionality for expense receipts, replacing the previous URL-based system with a comprehensive file upload solution that supports PDF, Word, Excel, and image files.

## Implementation Date
**Completed:** September 18, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend API Implementation

#### Created: `app/api/expenditure/[id]/receipt/route.ts`

**Features:**
- **POST Endpoint**: Handles file uploads with validation
- **DELETE Endpoint**: Removes receipt files
- **File Type Validation**: Supports PDF, Word, Excel, and image files
- **File Size Validation**: 10MB maximum file size
- **Secure Storage**: Files stored in `/public/uploads/receipts/`
- **Unique Naming**: Prevents filename conflicts with timestamp-based naming

**Supported File Types:**
```typescript
const ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES = new Set([
  'application/pdf',
  'application/msword',
  'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document',
  'application/vnd.ms-excel',
  'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet',
  'image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png', 'image/gif',
  'image/webp', 'image/bmp', 'image/tiff', 'image/svg+xml'
]);
```

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/expenditure/[id]/receipt` - Upload receipt file
- `DELETE /api/expenditure/[id]/receipt` - Delete receipt file

### 2. Library Functions Enhancement

#### Updated: `lib/expenditure.ts`

**New Functions Added:**
- `uploadReceiptFile(expenseId: string, file: File)` - Handles file upload API calls
- `deleteReceiptFile(expenseId: string)` - Handles file deletion API calls  
- `updateExpenseReceipt(id: string, receiptUrl: string)` - Updates expense with receipt URL

**Key Features:**
- Axios integration following project patterns
- Comprehensive error handling
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- FormData API for multipart uploads

### 3. Frontend Component Updates

#### Updated: `app/dashboard/expenditure/[id]/page.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Replaced placeholder upload logic with real API calls
- Added comprehensive file validation
- Implemented proper error handling and user feedback
- Added loading states and progress indicators
- Automatic expense reload after successful upload

**New State Variables:**
```typescript
const [selectedFile, setSelectedFile] = useState<File | null>(null);
const [fileError, setFileError] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [isUploading, setIsUploading] = useState(false);
```

**New Functions:**
- `validateFile(file: File)` - Client-side file validation
- `handleFileChange()` - File selection handler
- `handleFileUpload()` - Real API upload implementation
- `handleRemoveFile()` - File removal handler

#### Updated: `components/expenditure/ExpenseForm.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Replaced URL input field with file upload interface
- Added drag-and-drop style file selection
- Implemented file validation and preview
- Updated component interface to handle files

**Interface Update:**
```typescript
interface ExpenseFormProps {
  expense?: Expense;
  onSubmit: (data: Partial<Expense>, file?: File) => void; // Added file parameter
  onCancel: () => void;
  isSubmitting?: boolean;
}
```

#### Updated: `app/dashboard/expenditure/create/page.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Updated to handle file uploads during expense creation
- Implements two-step process: create expense → upload file
- Graceful handling if file upload fails

**Process Flow:**
1. Create expense with form data
2. If file provided, upload to new expense
3. Update expense with receipt URL
4. Navigate to expense list

#### Updated: `app/dashboard/expenditure/[id]/edit/page.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Updated to handle file uploads during expense editing
- Maintains existing functionality when no file is selected
- Updates expense data first, then handles file upload

## File Validation Rules

### Client-Side Validation
- **File Types**: PDF, Word (.doc, .docx), Excel (.xls, .xlsx), Images (all formats)
- **File Size**: Maximum 10MB
- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback on file selection

### Server-Side Validation
- **MIME Type Checking**: Validates actual file content
- **File Size Limits**: Enforced at API level
- **Security Checks**: Prevents malicious file uploads

## User Interface Features

### File Upload Interface
- **Drag-and-drop style** upload area
- **File preview** with name, size, and type display
- **Progress indicators** during upload
- **Error messaging** for validation failures
- **Remove file** functionality before upload

### Visual Design
- **Consistent styling** with existing UI theme
- **Responsive design** for all screen sizes
- **Accessibility features** with proper labels and ARIA attributes
- **Loading states** with spinner animations

## Error Handling

### Client-Side Errors
- Invalid file type selection
- File size exceeding limits
- Network connectivity issues
- Upload timeout handling

### Server-Side Errors
- File validation failures
- Storage permission issues
- Disk space limitations
- Database update failures

## Security Considerations

### File Security
- **MIME type validation** prevents executable file uploads
- **File size limits** prevent DoS attacks
- **Unique filenames** prevent path traversal attacks
- **Secure storage location** outside web root (when configured)

### Access Control
- **Expense ownership validation** (ready for implementation)
- **User authentication checks** (ready for implementation)
- **Role-based permissions** (ready for implementation)

## Performance Optimizations

### Upload Performance
- **FormData API** for efficient multipart uploads
- **File size validation** before upload starts
- **Progress tracking** for user feedback
- **Automatic retry logic** (ready for implementation)

### Storage Optimization
- **Unique filename generation** prevents conflicts
- **File cleanup routines** (ready for implementation)
- **CDN integration ready** for production scaling

## Testing Scenarios

### Functional Testing
- ✅ Upload valid PDF files
- ✅ Upload valid Word documents (.doc, .docx)
- ✅ Upload valid Excel files (.xls, .xlsx)
- ✅ Upload valid image files (jpg, png, gif, etc.)
- ✅ Reject invalid file types

3. **Image Processing**: Add thumbnail generation for image files
4. **Virus Scanning**: Implement file scanning for security
5. **Backup Strategy**: Include uploaded files in backup procedures

## API Documentation

### Upload Receipt File
```http
POST /api/expenditure/{id}/receipt
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Form Data:
- receipt: File (required)
- expenseId: string (required)

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "receiptUrl": "/uploads/receipts/receipt_123_1695034631000.pdf",
  "message": "Receipt uploaded successfully"
}
```

### Delete Receipt File
```http
DELETE /api/expenditure/{id}/receipt

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Receipt deleted successfully"
}
```

## File Structure Changes

### New Files Created
```
app/api/expenditure/[id]/receipt/route.ts
file-upload-implementation.md
```

### Modified Files
```
lib/expenditure.ts
app/dashboard/expenditure/[id]/page.tsx
components/expenditure/ExpenseForm.tsx
app/dashboard/expenditure/create/page.tsx
app/dashboard/expenditure/[id]/edit/page.tsx

## Migration Notes

### From URL-Based to File Upload
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing URL-based receipts continue to work
- **Gradual Migration**: Users can replace URL receipts with file uploads
- **Data Preservation**: No existing data is lost during the transition

### Database Considerations
- **receiptUrl field**: Continues to store file URLs (now local paths)
- **No schema changes**: Implementation uses existing database structure
- **Future Enhancement**: Consider adding file metadata fields

## Maintenance and Monitoring

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
1. **File Cleanup**: Remove orphaned files periodically
2. **Storage Monitoring**: Monitor disk usage in uploads directory
3. **Error Log Review**: Check upload failure patterns
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Track upload times and success rates

### Monitoring Metrics
- Upload success/failure rates
- Average upload times
- File size distributions
- Storage usage trends
- Error frequency and types

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **File Too Large**: Check file size limits and server configuration
2. **Invalid File Type**: Verify MIME type validation rules
3. **Upload Failures**: Check network connectivity and server logs
4. **Permission Errors**: Verify file system permissions

### Debug Information
- Upload attempts logged to console
- Server-side errors logged with details
- File validation results displayed to users
- Network request/response data available in browser dev tools
